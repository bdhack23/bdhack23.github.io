            I am currently a Junior enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and working towards earning my degree in Computer Sciences. I am also working towards a minor in Anthropology.My time at UNCCH has been valuable to me not just in terms of education, but in that it also has provided me with valuable life experience. I have met many new people and have had so many unique experiences at this beautiful university. Outside of college, I have gained experience with giving back to my community, which include donating Christmas gifts to poor families, as well as packing easy-to-cook meals for families in need.
            I am certain that my time here at UNC as well my experiences with helping others will instill me with the skills I need to be a valuable member of society as well as a hardworking, passionate employee in the Computer Sciences field.
