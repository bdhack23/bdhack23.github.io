                My hobbies include drawing, hiking, and taking photos of things I find beautiful or awe-inspiring. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have a deep appreciation and respect for the natural world, and most of my photos reflect this aspect of myself.  Many of my fondest memories have been made during my many explorations of  the great outdoors. I’ve been at the peaks of mountains and within the depths of underground caves. Every new adventure never fails to surprise me and teach me something new.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have also always had a love for travel, and have been to countries outside of the U.S. such as Mexico and Honduras. There are so many cultures outside of my home country to learn about and immerse oneself in.
                <br>
                <br>
                I’m very thankful that I get to travel as often as I do, and I hope to see even more of our wonderfully diverse world as I grow older.
